Last updated: 28/6/2025

ذكرك ("the app") is developed and maintained by an individual developer. This privacy policy explains how the app handles user information, permissions, and data usage.

1. No Personal Data Collection
The app does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email, phone number, or location history.

There is no user account, login, or analytics tracking in this app.

2. Permissions Used
The app requires the following permissions to function as intended:

Used only to fetch accurate prayer times from a public API based on your current location.

Your location is processed locally and is never stored or shared.

No continuous tracking is done.

 Background Location & Background Services

You receive prayer time notifications even if the app is closed

Prayer times and azkar data stay updated

No background data is collected or sent anywhere — this is for app functionality only.

 Notification Permission
Used to send local reminders and alerts for prayer times and azkar.
You can disable notifications at any time from your device settings.

3. Third-Party Services
This app may use certain Flutter or open-source packages (e.g., geolocator, flutter_local_notifications, flutter_background_service) for core functionality.

These services operate locally on your device and do not collect personal data on behalf of the developer.

4. Children’s Privacy
The app is designed for general audiences and does not knowingly collect any information from children.
